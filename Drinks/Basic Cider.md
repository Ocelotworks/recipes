# Basic Cider Recipe

Ingredients
===========
The following recipe assumes a final volume of around 20 Litres, adjust ingredients in the same ratio to change volume

1. Apple Juice and optionally summer fruits, if using both mix them at an 11:9 ratio of Apple:Summer Fruit
2. Yeast, preferably cider yeast but bread yeast will work in a pinch (About 1 teaspoon will do)
3. Sugar (300g)

Equipment
=========
1. Large pot like a stewing pot
2. Storage container such as a glass demijohn or clean/brand new fuel drum, for this recipe I will assume my standard 20L fuel container.
3. An airlock with water in it, that can be fitted to the container
4. Siphon pump or a tube for manual siphoning
5. Thermometer (Preferably digital for accuracy)

Instructions
============
1. Add the liquid to the pot, this can be done in batches so the ratio is irrelevant at this step, also add the sugar throughout yout
2. Bring the liquid in the pot to 70 C, measuring with the thermometer
3. Add the heated liquid to the container using the siphon tube or pump
4. Repeat until entire liquid volume has been heated and added to the container
5. Leave the container to completely cool to room temperature
6. Add the Yeast
7. Insert the airlock and leave the container in a reasonably warm room to ferment
8. After around 5 days to a week, the airlock should have stopped bubbling, if not wait longer
9. Siphon the cider out of the container and into bottles, ensure you don't bottle the dead yeast at the bottom of the container as this will leave a poor tasting bottle
