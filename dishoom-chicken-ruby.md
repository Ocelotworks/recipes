## Method

### Makhani Sauce Preparation

1. **Fry the Garlic:**
   - Finely dice about 15g of garlic. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, fry the diced garlic in the vegetable oil until light golden and slightly crispy (7–8 minutes). Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Paste:**
   - Grate the remaining garlic along with the ginger into a smooth paste using a microplane or mortar and pestle.

3. **Puree the Tomatoes:**
   - Blitz the chopped tomatoes in a blender until smooth.

4. **Spice It Up:**
   - Return the saucepan to medium-high heat. Add the bay leaves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks. Let them crackle for about 1 minute.
   - Lower the heat and stir in the garlic-ginger paste. Cook for 5 minutes, allowing the paste to brown gently (do not let it burn).

5. **Simmer the Sauce:**
   - Stir in the pureed tomatoes along with the salt and chilli powder. Bring the mixture to a rapid simmer and cook until reduced by half (about 30 minutes), stirring regularly.
   - Finally, add the butter and simmer for an extra 5 minutes. Just before finishing, stir in the double cream.

### Chicken Preparation and Assembly

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - Place the marinade ingredients (ginger, garlic, salt, deggi mirch, cumin, garam masala, lime juice, oil, and Greek yoghurt) in a blender and process until smooth.
   - Toss the chicken chunks in the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for 6–24 hours.

2. **Grill the Chicken:**
   - Preheat your grill to medium-high.
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it on a rack in a grill pan. Brush with the melted butter and grill for 8–10 minutes, turning halfway, until the chicken is charred and cooked through.

3. **Combine the Curry:**
   - In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the makhani sauce, 50ml double cream, and the grilled chicken.
   - Simmer gently for 10 minutes to meld the flavors.

4. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Garnish the dish with ginger matchsticks, chopped coriander, and pomegranate seeds.
   - Serve hot with steamed rice or naan.

### Garam Masala Preparation

You can choose one of the following methods:

#### **Pan Method (Quick)**

1. Place the following spices into a cold, dry frying pan:
   - Black cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds.
2. Over medium heat, toast the spices for about 2 minutes—shaking the pan regularly to ensure even toasting.
3. If desired, add the poppy seeds and dried rose petals for a delicate finish.
4. Allow the mixture to cool, then grind in a spice grinder until you obtain a fine powder.

#### **Oven Method (For a Fuller, Richer Flavour)**

1. Preheat your oven to 50°C (or the lowest setting available).
2. Spread all the spices (black cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, bay leaf, and mace blades) evenly on a baking sheet.
3. Place in the oven for about 2½ hours.
4. Add the poppy seeds and dried rose petals, return the tray to the oven, then turn it off and let the spices cool in the oven for 30 minutes.
5. Once cooled, grind everything to a fine powder using a spice grinder.

Store your garam masala in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to one month.
