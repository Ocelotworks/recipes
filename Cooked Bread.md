# Cooked Bread

Colloquially known as 'Toast', this bread based delicacy has been around for hundreds of years and is a substantial staple in most homes as a breakfast meal.

Ingredients
===========
1. Bread
2. Butter/Honey/Nutella/Jam/Any Other Topping or combination

Instructions
============
1. Place the raw bread in a toaster oven (No preheating is required) and set the dial to the desired level of cooking.
2. Once the toaster oven has completed the induction based cooking, remove the toast and apply the desired toppings in your preferred order. I recommend just Nutella.

Adapt this recipe:
==================
In order to adapt this recipe, you can change the cooking time, number of slices and the type of bread you select. Thicker breads can yield a nicer end product due as they can have a soft inner core to complement the tougher outer shell of the cooked bread.
