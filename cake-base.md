# Cake Base
This cake is perfect for nearly any sort of flavourings. While it is too light for chocolate or fruit chips, it makes a perfect lemon drizzle, or coffee cake.

Ingredients
===========
- 255g self raising flour
- 255g unsalted butter, softened
- 4x medium eggs
- 255g caster sugar

###Flavourings

####Lemon drizzle
- 185g caster sugar
- juice from 2 medium lemons

####Coffee
-Camp coffee

Instructions
============
1. Mix the caster sugar and the softened butter until the mixture is light and looking like cream
2. Add the four eggs, one at a time, mixing inbetween each one. The egg yolk shouldn't be visable, but the mixture will get very watery looking
3. Add the flour, and mix well. The more mixing is done here, the more air is added to the mixture, and the lighter the cake is. Don't forget to mix the bottom of the bowl too.
4. Optional: Add flavourings, such as camp coffee, to taste.
5. Bake for 1 hour, at 180Â°C
6. Optional: Drizzle lemon sauce onto cake.
7. Serve
