# Marinade
Used to sweeten and soften meat before being slow cooked in a smoker for 8-12 hours. Perfect with chicken, and ham.

Ingredients
===========
- 100g barbeque sauce
- A splash of vinegar (to thin the marinade)
- Ground pepper
- Ground garlic
- Salt

Instructions
============
1. Add the splash of vinegar to the sauce. The mix should be thinner than the original sauce, but not as thin as water.
2. Add the pepper, garlic, and salt - season to taste.
3. Spread the marinade over the meat - let this sit for 6-24 hours in a fridge, the longer the better.
4. Slow cook. The sugars in the sauce will slowly caramelise bringing a slightly sweet flavour to the meat, while the vinegar helps break down the outside of the meat, which brings an excellent texture to it.
