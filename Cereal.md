==================
You can also serve cereal without milk if you hate yourself and your guests/family. This will leave a dry throat, potential choking hazard and overall unpleasant experience.
Additionally, you can leave the milk in the cereal for an extended period of time before consumption in order to attain a horrifyingly mushy cereal that would make the hardest of stomachs cry.
