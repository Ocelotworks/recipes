# Make your cheap nasty noodles taste pretty decent

Ingredients
===========
- The cheapest noodles you can find, Tesco do an own brand curry set for 20p each
- Curry powder (Â£1 from Tesco, you'll see why you need it soon)
- Chicken chunks of your choosing, either hand made or sandwich fillers from a shop
- Water
- A pinch of salt

Method
======
1. Use the water volume suggested on the back of your chosen noodles and bring to the boil
2. Add the noodles to the boiling water and throw away the supplied curry powder
3. Add the good curry powder you bought
4. Add the chicken and cook until most of the water has boiled off
5. Add the salt, mix and serve in a bowl

This method can be used with any noodles and any substitute powder to replace the supplied powder and makes a surprisingly big difference to overall taste so experiment and see what you fancy.
