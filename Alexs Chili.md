# Alexs Chili

Probably overly complex but still pretty good

Ingredients
-----------
- 1.5kg Mince beef 
- 1 large onion sliced 
- 1 can of kidney beans
- 1 can of pinto beans
- 2 cans of chopped or plum tomatos
- 2 bell peppers
- 2 tbsp of paprika
- 1 tbsp of cayenne 
- 1 tbsp of ground corriander seeds
- 1 tbsp of cumin
- chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 or 2 garlic cloves crushed or diced
- 1 jar of chipotle paste (usually 95g pots)
- 1 tbsp of coco powder
- salt to taste
- pepper to taste
- 2 or 3 medium size chili peppers (use whatever peppers you want)
- olive oil
- 1 bottle of ale
- 2 tbsp of tomato paste

Method
------

1. Slice bell and chili peppers into strips and cook in a large pot (preferably one that can be put in the oven) on a medium-low heat in olive oil.
2. Once the peppers are starting to soften add most of the ale into the pot and leave on a low heat.
3. Using a hand blender, blend the peppers until you get a puree, leaving on a low heat.
4. In a seperate pan, brown the beef until a golden brown layer forms. Do this in small batches for best results, place cooked beef in a bowl for later use.
5. Once all the beef has been cooked, add the remaining ale into the empty pan to remove any beef stuck to the pan, then pour this into the pot with the chilis
6. In a new (or the same pan just cleaned) add some olive oil and heat on a medium-low heat before adding the onion(s), cooking until translucent.
7. Pre-heat oven to 180 celsius 
8. Add the paprika, cayenne, ground corriander seeds, and cumin stirring well and adding oil so that everything is well coated.
9. In a blender (or using a hand blender) add the chopped tomatos  and a pinch of salt, blending until consitent.
10. Add the blended tomatos and tomato paste into the pan with the onions, stirring until evenly coated, adding water if too dry.
11. Add the stock to the onions, mix, then pour the onions and sauce to the stewed peppers, setting the heat to medium.
12. Add the chipotle to the pot using as much as you want (usually a whole jar is good) and stir
13. Add the beans, mince beef, and coco powder
14. put the lid on the pot and leave in the oven for about 20-50 mins
15. Serve with rice or wraps
