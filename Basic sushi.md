# Basic sushi
Recipies for making sushi rice, Maki, Uramaki, Nigiri, and Temari sushi. Try to use fish as fresh as possible, or get flash frozen fish.

When adding the rice to the rolls keep a bowl of water with a small amount of white rice vineagr in it, dip you hands and knife in this to stop the rice sticking.

When filling the rolls, leave half an inch on one side of the nori so everything stays together. A sushi mat will make life easier, but isnt required.

I also reccomend looking at images of what each dish looks like so you get a feel of what everying should look like.

Serve with wasabi, pickled ginger, and light soy sauce. In my experience a full meal of sushi lacks variety so I recommend doing something additional like Negima Yakitori or Tonkatsu.
